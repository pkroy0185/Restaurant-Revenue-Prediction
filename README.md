# Restaurant-Revenue-Prediction
Dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/restaurant-revenue-prediction/data.
The necessary data pre-processing was done on datasets.
All 5 regression models were implemented on datasets.
Models are 1> Linear regression 2> Multiple-Linear Regression 3> Polynomial regression 4> Decision tree regression and 5> Random forest regression.
Mean squared error on predicted datasets with test datasets was found.
In Random forest classifier, importance of each features was found and visualized.
Again a new model was made taking the most important metrics.
Result of both models were compared.
